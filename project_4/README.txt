This program scans input files for operations, calculates the answer, and prints the output to the output file.
Fractions are involved in these operations, so a Rational class was created to properly store the values of
numerators and denominators.

compile instructions: 
    g++ Wall test_rational.cpp Rational.cpp -o rational_math
    or make

running the program:
    run the program by using the executable, a list of input file names, and lastly the output file
    for example: ./rational_math input1.txt input2.txt output.txt
